# My First GitHub Repository

Hello 
This is my first ever repository on GitHub.

I am currently in the learning phase and using this repository to:
- Practice Git and GitHub commands
- Understand version control
- Learn how repositories, commits, and pushes work
- Build a strong foundation for DevOps and software development

This repository may contain:
- Test files
- Practice code
- Notes and experiments

More updates will be added as I continue learning
